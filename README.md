# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository contains my practice code and notes for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in JavaScript.

## Introduction

In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress, sharing code implementations of various data structures and algorithms, and keeping notes to reinforce my learning.

## Contents

1. [Data Structures](#data-structures)
2. [Algorithms](#algorithms)
3. [Resources](#resources)

## Data Structures

Here, I'll be implementing and documenting various data structures, such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Tries

## Algorithms

I'll also be implementing and discussing various algorithms, including:

- Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btwn Unsigned vs signed numbers
- Stability in Sorting
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
- Binary Search
- Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, - Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
- Permutations
- Subsets
BFS Graph
- DFS Graph
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to - implement)
- Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, - post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
- External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
- Topological Sort
- Detect cycle in an undirected graph
- Detect a cycle in a directed graph
- Count connected components in a graph
- Find strongly connected components in a graph
